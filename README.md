## Course Overview

The course focuses on three essential aspects of deep neural networks: hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and optimization. It explores advanced techniques and best practices to overcome common challenges encountered during the development and training of deep learning models.

The course is divided into the following sections:

1. **WEEK1: Practical Aspect of Deep Learning** Discover and experiment with a variety of different initialization methods, apply L2 regularization and dropout to avoid model overfitting, then apply gradient checking to identify errors in a fraud detection model.
- `lectures/`: This directory contains lecture slides and accompanying materials for each section of the course.

2. **WEEK2: Optimization Algorithms** Develop your deep learning toolbox by adding more advanced optimizations, random minibatching, and learning rate decay scheduling to speed up your models.

3. **WEEK3: Hyperparameter Tuning, Batch Normalization and Programming Frameworks** Explore TensorFlow, a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks quickly and easily, then train a neural network on a TensorFlow dataset.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `lectures/`: This directory contains lecture slides and accompanying materials for each section of the course.
- `notebooks/`: Here, you can find Jupyter notebooks that provide hands-on exercises and implementation examples.
- `datasets/`: It includes the datasets used in the course exercises and case studies.
- `resources/`: This directory contains additional resources, such as papers, articles, and relevant links for further exploration.
