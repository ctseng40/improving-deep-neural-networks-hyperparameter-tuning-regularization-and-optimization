## Course Overview

The course focuses on three essential aspects of deep neural networks: hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and optimization. It explores advanced techniques and best practices to overcome common challenges encountered during the development and training of deep learning models.

The course is divided into the following sections:

1. **Introduction to Hyperparameter Tuning:** This section provides an overview of hyperparameters and their impact on model performance. It introduces techniques such as random search and grid search for hyperparameter optimization.

2. **Regularization Techniques:** Here, different regularization methods are covered, including L1 and L2 regularization, dropout regularization, and data augmentation. Participants learn how to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization capability of their models.

3. **Optimization Algorithms:** This section delves into various optimization algorithms used for training deep neural networks. It covers topics like gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, momentum, RMSprop, and Adam optimization.

4. **Practical Guidelines and Case Studies:** The course concludes with practical guidelines and case studies that showcase real-world applications of the techniques discussed. Participants gain insights into industry best practices and learn how to approach different scenarios effectively.
